# Multiplication-Table-Using-C

This repository contains an efficient implementation of the multiplication table in C, utilizing for loops, while loops, and do-while loops to demonstrate structured programming and iteration control. The program allows users to generate multiplication tables dynamically based on user input, ensuring flexibility and optimized execution.


# What This Project Includes:
âœ… For Loop Implementation â€“ A structured approach to generating multiplication tables.

âœ… While Loop Implementation â€“ Demonstrates looping based on a condition.

âœ… Do-While Loop Implementation â€“ Ensures execution before checking conditions.

âœ… User Input Support â€“ Enter any number to generate a customized multiplication table.

âœ… Beginner-Friendly Code â€“ Simple, well-commented, and easy to understand.

# Why I Made This?
I am learning C programming and wanted to practice loops in a practical way. This project helped me understand iteration, user input handling, and structured programming.
